# ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Machine Learning Capstone Project: Laptop Price Predictor! ðŸš€

## Project Overview
The **Laptop Price Predictor** is a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting laptop prices with high accuracy. This project showcases advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, model optimization, and deployment techniques.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaned dataset** by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
- **Standardized data types** for consistency.

## Feature Engineering
- **Transformed features** using binning for nominal columns.
- **Engineered new features** for memory, CPU, GPU, and screen resolution.

## Advanced Feature Selection
- **Conducted hypothesis testing (ANOVA)** for categorical features.
- **Utilized correlation coefficients** to select relevant numerical features.

## Pipeline and Column Transformers
- **Built robust data pipelines** incorporating transformations and scaling techniques.
- Used **MinMaxScaler** for numerical features and **One Hot Encoding** for nominal features.

## Algorithm Testing and Optimization
- **Evaluated multiple algorithms**; Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best performer.
- Achieved an **RÂ² score of 0.88** after hyperparameter tuning and logarithmic transformation.

## Handling Mixed Data Types
- **Separated and standardized mixed columns** like memory and screen resolution.
- Applied **custom functions** for categorical feature extraction.

## Outlier Management
- **Implemented clipping strategies** for outlier removal in continuous variables.
- Ensured **normal distribution** and improved model performance.

## Model Deployment
- **Deployed the final model** using Gradio for real-time predictions.
- Enabled a **user-friendly interface** for practical usage.

## Quantified Achievements
- **Increased RÂ² score from 0.85 to 0.88**.
- **Enhanced prediction accuracy** for mid-range and gaming laptops by leveraging detailed specifications.

## Key Insights and Future Work
- **Identified gaps** in data for high-end brands like Apple and HP.
- Plan to **incorporate more granular data** for improved accuracy in future iterations.
